        <h1>Our Belief and Investment Approach</h1>
        <p>
          Equity by its very nature is a volatile asset class. A rigorous,
          in-depth and disciplined research process is essential to ride the
          market volatility and consistently deliver superior risk adjusted
          returns over long periods of time. Our research process is based on
          time tested

        <div class="invest-box2">
          <p>
            Our investment approach is based on the BMV model of investing,
            <b>(1) Business, (2) Management and (3) Valuation, </b>in that
            particular order
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> Business:</b> Identifying and investing in the right business is
            very important, businesses with large market opportunities, strong
            competitive characteristics and high ROEs. Good businesses over a
            period of time tend to deliver superior returns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Management:</b> Identifying exceptional managements running these
            businesses, having industry leader mindset and hunger for growth
            driven by rational capital allocation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Valuation:</b> Last but clearly not the least is paying the right
            value for these businesses. Staying ahead of others helps a lot in
            getting these opportunities at high margin of safety. Margin of
            safety helps in downside protection and capital preservation.

        <h1>Psychology of Investing</h1>
        <p>
          Investment is as much about Psychology as about the economics of it.
          Our research process helps us stay ahead of others and focus on
          asymmetric risk rewards and earning inflection points with high margin
          of safety. The most crucial aspect of investment is selling right.
          Most of the people either sell too early or too late. A disciplined
          approach to selling to maximize returns is as important as buying the
          right stock.

            understanding of businesses and promoters by riding the business
            growth opportunities created by excellent teams of business owners

            investor experience hence our analytical skill grips your
